        <h2>Enter Nithin</h2>
        <p>Nithin, a gay man with an extraordinary talent for giving mind-blowing blowjobs, steps forward. Known in his small town for his unique skill set, he decides to use his gift to bring peace. With a twinkle in his eye and a spring in his step, he sets out on his daring mission, ready to give these villains a taste of their own medicineâ€”or something even more satisfying.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="plan" class="story-section fade-in">
        <h2>The Plan</h2>
        <p>Nithin's plan is simple: he will give each villain a blowjob, satisfying their deepest desires and temporarily pacifying them. With the villains neutralized, the Avengers can regroup and find a permanent solution.</p>

            <p><strong>Loki:</strong> Nithin tracks down Loki in Asgard. With a sly wink, he offers his service, and Loki, ever the opportunist, agrees. "Very well, mortal," he purrs. "Let's see what you've got." Nithin delivers, and Loki is left speechless for once.</p>
